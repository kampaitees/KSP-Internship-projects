## KSP Internship Projects
Here all  the projects are present which I had done during my internship for KSP Computer Wing

During the internship I had done two projects CRIMINAL RECOGNITION and VUNLERABILITY MAPPING(and prediction of the active crime prone
areas)

For criminal recognition i have to predict the probability that this particular criminal can be found with this particular probability
in a particular record.
